Duke seems to have the standard Echidna body, 
but with much differences to the actual Knuckles. 
His skin tones are darker,
the crescent on his chest is fully blackened, 
and he seems to have a not much noticeable tail. 
His shoe stripes also seem to have a completely different style. 
However, in his beast form, he seems to have grown taller, 
now sporting bandages on his dreadlocks. 
His eyes are also crazy/aggressive. His tail is now more visible, 
and his shoes are darker.
Duke can take on any appearance, but likes Knucklesâ€™ form for the looks.

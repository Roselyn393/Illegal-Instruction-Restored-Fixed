NormalCD sports many differences than a standard hedgehog in the Sonic universe. 
He is shorter than Sonic and dawns a pale blue fur color. 
His skin color is actually another shade of blue, sort of a dark cyan. 
His sclera is a sky blue, while having lime green and red eyes. 
His grin shows his exposed red teeth. 
He has stripes on the bottom of his arms and legs and has a new shoe style. 
His shoes instead of being white and red, they are white, black, and a sort of 
orange-red crystal feature
NormalCD does not need to breathe, he just likes it.
